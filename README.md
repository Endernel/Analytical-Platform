# Analytical Platform

A simple analytical platform built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and HTML/CSS. The platform allows users to add, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. It provides a minimal frontend interface for managing the list of tasks.

## **Features**

- Custom pink theme
- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blog posts
- MongoDB integration using Mongoose

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
- A code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Register at [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) for database setup

## **Installation and Setup**

### Step 1: Create a Folder
Create a folder where all your working files will be stored. For example, you can name it `analytics`.

### Step 2: Open the Folder in a Code Editor
Open the folder in your code editor, such as Visual Studio Code.

### Step 3: Initialize the Project and Install Dependencies

1. Initialize a new Node.js project by running:
   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```
   This will create a `package.json` file with the default settings.

2. Install the necessary libraries for your project by running:
   ```sh
   npm install express mongoose chart.js
   ```

We will be using the following Node libraries:

- **Express**: A web framework for Node.js that simplifies server creation and handles routing and HTTP requests/responses.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to interact with your MongoDB Atlas database by defining schemas and models.
- **Chart.js**: A JavaScript library for creating charts and visualizations in the browser.

### Step 4: Set up MongoDB

1. Create a free account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).
2. Create a new cluster and database.
3. Copy the MongoDB connection URL and store it in `server.js` file in the following format:
   ```js
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   mongoose.connect('YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_URL', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
   ```

Your project is now set up and ready for further development!

## **Running the Application**

Once the environment is set up, you can run the application by using:
```sh
node server.js
```
By default, the app will be running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## **Usage**

- **`server.js`**: Contains the backend logic. Ensure you insert your MongoDB connection URI in this file.
- **`insertData.js`**: This file allows modification of store data as needed.
- **`public/`**: Contains frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS) for user interaction.

## **Custom Styling**
The project uses a pink color palette-style theme for the user interface. All the styles are defined in `styles.css`, and you can update colors by modifying the CSS in `public/styles.css`.
